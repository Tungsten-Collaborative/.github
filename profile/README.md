# Software Capabilities
We have a proven track record in developing software throughout the complete stack. Right from tightly embedded systems like [Quickerr automatic swager](https://quickerrsystems.com/) and Ring Rescue [ring cutter](https://www.ringrescue.com/) up to complex tracking satellite systems including inverse kinematics to position the axes, such that the dish continuously faces a selected satellite from a moving platform.

We are very experienced in 
- embedded systems
- satellite systems
- motion control
- medical devices
- drones
- GUI development (embedded and web)

# Open Source
We are a heavy user and strong proponent of the open source philosophy. Generally the software and hardware we develop is proprietary to a specific client but occassionally we develop core functions that can be used across a range of product developments. In those cases it is sometimes appropriate to offer these developments to the open source community.
